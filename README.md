# TeamShrug
University Registration System for Auburn Software Modeling and Design

This is the group Project for Team Shrug for the Spring Semester of COMP 3700 at Auburn University.

The working application is in the folder "Console Version". The rest of the application is what was completed as a webpage before we worked on the console application version.
